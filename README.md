# FlappyUfo-JAVA-GAME

flappy Ufo JAVA GAME is a simple arcade game implemented in Java, typically using the Swing library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The game features a bird that moves automatically across the screen, and the player controls the bird's vertical movement by pressing the spacebar to make it jump, thereby avoiding obstacles such as pipes. The objective is to navigate the ufo character through gaps between the pipes without colliding with them or the ground, with each successfully passed pipe increasing the player's score by one point.

The game is often built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, with classes defined for the bird, pipes, and game logic. The bird's movement is simulated using velocity, where pressing the spacebar applies an upward force, and gravity continuously pulls the bird downward. Collision detection is implemented to check if the bird hits a pipe, the ground, or the top of the screen, which results in a game over. The game loop, often managed by a Timer, updates the positions of the bird and pipes, and repaints the screen to reflect the current state.
